# Progressively-Calculating-PI
Another version of approximation of PI where its actually calculated, using the ratio between a square and its touching circle. Highly inspired by The Coding Train on Youtube (their video on it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cNnf_7e92Q&t=48s). 

Yes I couldn't wait two days and post this on PI day instead
